# Long Description
In Reclaim Humanity you will help Wollo save the entire humankind, which has been paralyzed by a terrible fast-spreding virus.

Wollo is a cute little robot that is not affected by this virus due to its robotic nature and he really wants to help his human friends.

Yeah, but what can a robot alone do? Luckily its creator, a scientist best known as Dr.IDK, had just finished his latest invention: the TranceSmitter! Through this powerful device, Wollo can read (and sometimes talk) to the mind of any paralyzed human.

In this role-playing game you must explore the world looking for helpful informations in humans minds. You can also craft items once you find the right recipe and the right ingredients.

But be aware: even though there are no humans, there are still enemies that can attack you! Use the items that you find to produce energy in the laboratory to keep it working and to unlock new power-ups and moves to defend yourself. 

Follow carefully the Dr.IDK instructions to finally save the humanity from this horrible virus!
